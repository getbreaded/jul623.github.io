        <h1>I love you, Shann.</h1>
        <h2>The <em><strong>Bread</strong></em> we knew from a year ago would be <em>quaking</em> if she saw herself saying that nonchalantly.
        She'd be lying on the bed, or probably on the couch, smiling at the pics her <em>best friend</em> would send her.</h2>

        <h2><strong>Best Friend.</strong> I always described Shann as my best friend. She was always the person I would tell things first to.
             She was always there, albeit irritating at times (especially whenever she got lucky 5-star pulls in Genshin, I never told her about this), 
             but she was always there. I didn't know if this would last; I didn't know if she would always be the one I turned to first, 
             that wasn't until it came to the point when I did all my <strong>firsts <em>with her</em></strong>.</h2>

        <h2>Hi was the first ever message I sent her, followed by a Pusheen Cat Sticker waving hi. It was July 2, 2016. 8:11am. A Saturday. I was the first to message. 
            Even then, <em>I had the balls.</em> I didn't know it then, but this girl would be someone very, very special in my life.</h2>

        <h2>Fast forward to today. I'm sitting at my desk at 1:16am, on July 6, 2023; Exactly 6 years, 11 months and 28 days since my first ever message to her. 
            A lot has changed, like the fact that I start the day thinking of her; how my thumbs move on their own without a single thought, as if it's only 
            human nature to subconsciously type the words "I love you," or rather, "I love you, Shann" (with a couple heart emojis, oh how I love modern technology);
             or how I go to sleep crying because she's so pretty in my grasp (holding my phone with her picture open, not in real life).</h2>

        <h3 class="emphasis">Oh has a lot changed.</h3>

        <h2>It's been 6 years. I'm looking forward for more. The future will change us immensely, but I hope that my love for you will stay constant. 
            No matter the highs or lows that will inevitably come. No matter what relationship we'll come to have.</h2>
        
        <h3 id="last"> Happy July 6, Shann. I love you. Always.</h3>
        <p>Please don't ask me if I can make anything here a heart. I don't know how.</p>
        <p>With Love, Garn.</p>
